Masonry Layout for SAPUI5


# What is Masonry
Masonry is a JavaScript grid layout library. It works by placing elements in optimal position based on available vertical space, sort of like a mason fitting stones in a wall. Youâ€™ve probably seen it in use all over the Internet. - https://masonry.desandro.com/

With this new Custom Control, masonry layout is achieved in UI5. 

It creates a layout similar to Tiles in SAPUI5 but of different sizes.

This makes it to stand out and look unique and beautiful.
